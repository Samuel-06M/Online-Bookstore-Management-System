Project Title: Online Bookstore Management System
Project Overview:
The Online Bookstore Management System is a web-based application designed to manage the operations of a bookstore. It provides functionality for both customers and administrators. Customers can browse books, place orders, make payments, and track their order status. Administrators can manage inventory, add/edit/delete books, view order details, and generate reports.
Technologies Used:
•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
•	Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
•	Authentication & Authorization: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
•	Payment Gateway Integration: Stripe API
•	Version Control: Git
•	Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes (for scaling)
Features:
1.	User Authentication: Users can sign up, sign in, and reset their passwords.
2.	Product Catalog: Display books with details such as title, author, description, and price.
3.	Shopping Cart: Allow users to add/remove books from their cart and update quantities.
4.	Checkout Process: Enable users to proceed to checkout, enter shipping details, and make payments securely.
5.	Order Management: Track order history, view order details, and update order status.
6.	Admin Dashboard: Provide administrators with a dashboard to manage inventory, view sales analytics, and generate reports.
7.	CRUD Operations: Allow admins to add, edit, and delete books from the catalog.
Project Structure:
•	frontend/: Contains the frontend codebase (React components, CSS stylesheets).
•	backend/: Contains the backend codebase (Node.js, Express.js APIs, MongoDB models).
•	docs/: Documentation files including project requirements, design documents, and user manuals.
•	docker-compose.yml: Docker Compose configuration for local development environment setup.
•	kubernetes/: Kubernetes configuration files for deploying the application to a production environment.
•	README.md: Project overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
Development Workflow:
1.	Requirement Analysis: Gather and document project requirements.
2.	Design Phase: Design the system architecture, database schema, and user interfaces.
3.	Implementation: Develop frontend and backend modules according to the design specifications.
4.	Testing: Conduct unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure functionality and reliability.
5.	Deployment: Deploy the application to staging and production environments using Docker and Kubernetes.
6.	Monitoring & Maintenance: Monitor application performance, handle bug fixes, and implement feature enhancements as needed.
Team Structure:
•	Project Manager: Oversees project planning, scheduling, and resource allocation.
•	Backend Developers: Responsible for implementing server-side logic, APIs, and database operations.
•	Frontend Developers: Design and develop user interfaces and client-side functionality.
•	QA Engineers: Perform testing activities including manual testing, automated testing, and regression testing.
•	DevOps Engineers: Handle deployment, infrastructure management, and system maintenance tasks.
Project Timeline:
•	Planning & Design: 2 weeks
•	Implementation & Testing: 8 weeks
•	Deployment & Optimization: 2 weeks
•	Maintenance & Support: Ongoing
Project Deliverables:
•	Source Code: GitHub repository with frontend and backend code.
